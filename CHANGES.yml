        Initial release.

        This code is largely transported from Python 3.5
        source code at `hg.python.org <https://hg.python.org>`_,
        (especially the ``collections`` and ``reprlib`` modules).
        Several changes have been made to ensure Python 2.6
        compatibility, and tests and packaging have been added.

	    It is entirely intended as a bridge from earlier Python
	    releases (especially Python 2.6, Python 3.2, and PyPy3
	    releases based on Python 3.2) to modern ones.
